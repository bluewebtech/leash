- CHANGE LOG -

2013-08-07 - Added by Peter Morrison
	- Added support for unit testing with PHPUnit. To enable unit testing with PHPUnit, 
		the path to the phpunit binary must be defined within config.php. Where to add 
		the path to the PHPUnit binary should be quite obvious if your eyes are open. 
		All unit tests will be saved within the /app/tests/ directory which should be 
		quite obvious as well. All unit tests will only be available for viewing in a 
		development environment and can be viewing within the browser by visiting 
		http://<domain>/unit-tests/. All tests can be ran by clicking a test located in 
		the available list. Currently, no unit tests will be displayed if no tests have 
		been defined within the /app/tests/ directory. This class will be going under 
		heavy development for improved results. For tests to be ran in the browser, the 
		PHP shell_exec function must be enabled. If the shell_exec function is not 
		enabled, an error will be displayed when trying to execute a test in the browser.
